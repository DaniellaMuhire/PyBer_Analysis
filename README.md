# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to perform an exploratory analysis on data for PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app. To do so, we create several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. The analysis and visualizations we produce help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 
## Resources
- Data Source: [city_data](Resources/city_data.csv) [ride_data]((Resources/ride_data.csv)
- Software:

Based on the image above, we can see that urban cities have more rides compare to rural and suburban cities. It only makes sense that urban cities would then have more drivers and a great amount of rate(fare) compare to rural and suburban cities. We can notice that the average rate per ride in urban cities is inferior to the average rate per ride in rural and suburban cities. And the less the average per ride, the less the average rate for drivers.
We also notice that rural and suburban cities have a higher average rate per driver compare to the average per ride in those cities. This can be explained by the fact in rural and suburban cities, we have more rides and less drivers.

The chart above shows the total fare per type of city on a weekly basis.

We notice that the total fare  in the rural cities is about 3.5 and 2.5 times lower than urban and suburban cities.

## Summary

Based on the analysis performed, here are our recommendations:

1. To have more drivers in rural cities. In fact, we can see that the less drivers we have, the less is the fares;
2. Try to have less drivers compare to rides in urban cities. In that case, we generate a bigger revenue for drivers;
3. Perfor the analysis of fares on monthly and year basis to see if we have any trend.
